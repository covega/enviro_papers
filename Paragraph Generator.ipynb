This directly affects Virginia's ability to attract clean energy jobs and innovate in the transportation sector.

David Suetterlein voted to improve monitoring of elecric utilities' energy efficienty programs, which promotes meaningful, independent assessment of electric utilities' sustainability. David Suetterlein voted against strengthening a carbon tax on electric generation facilities.

Lee Ware voted to preserve Virginia's ability to enter into a regional cap and trade program (RGGI).

Lee Ware voted against establishing an environmental justice council, which denies the Governor meaningful advice about climate change's impact on low income communities.
